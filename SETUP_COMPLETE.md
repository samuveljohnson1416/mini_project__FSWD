## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Configure MongoDB Atlas**
   - Go to https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
   - Create a free cluster
   - Get your connection string
   - Add it to `server/.env` as `MONGODB_URI`

2. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create `server/.env` file:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/expense-tracker?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```

   Create `.env` file in root:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

3. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   # Run both client and server
   npm run dev:all
   
   # OR run separately:
   # Terminal 1:
   npm run server
   
   # Terminal 2:
   npm run client
   ```

4. **Test the application**
   - Open http://localhost:5173
   - Create an account (Signup)
   - Login with your credentials
   - Try adding expenses:
     * "tea 25"
     * "lunch 250"
     * "electricity bill 500"
     * "uber 150"
   - Check the Analytics page
   - Try editing and deleting expenses
   - Test filters and search
